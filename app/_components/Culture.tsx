      <p>
        The Olmec civilization, often considered the mother culture of
        Mesoamerica, was a highly influential early civilization in present-day
        Veracruz and Tabasco, Mexico.
      </p>
      <p>Here are the key aspects of Olmec culture:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Geographical Location The Olmec heartland is primarily in the tropical
          lowlands of south-central Mexico, specifically in the modern-day
          states of Veracruz and Tabasco.
        </li>
        <li>
          Time Period The Olmec civilization thrived from approximately 1500 BCE
          to 400 BCE.
        </li>
        <li>
          Major Sites San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n: One of the earliest Olmec
          centers, known for its large-scale monuments and complex society. La
          Venta: Famous for its massive earthen pyramid and richly decorated
          tombs. Tres Zapotes: Known for the later phase of Olmec civilization
          and the discovery of the earliest Long Count calendar date.
        </li>
        <li>
          Art and Iconography Colossal Heads: The Olmecs are famous for their
          enormous stone heads, carved from basalt boulders, which are believed
          to represent rulers. Jade Artifacts: They worked extensively with
          jade, creating small, detailed figurines, masks, and other items.
          Were-Jaguar Motif: A common theme in Olmec art depicting a
          human-jaguar hybrid, symbolizing shamanistic beliefs and the power of
          transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Architecture The Olmecs built large ceremonial centers with pyramids,
          plazas, and platforms. Their architecture was advanced, featuring
          drainage systems and large public spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Writing and Numeration The Olmecs developed early forms of writing and
          a complex calendar system, which influenced subsequent Mesoamerican
          cultures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Religion and Mythology The Olmec religion was polytheistic, involving
          various deities connected to natural elements like rain, earth, and
          maize. Shamanism played a significant role, with shamans believed to
          communicate with the spiritual world and transform into animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          Society and Politics Olmec society was hierarchical, with a strong
          centralized leadership and distinct social classes, including elites,
          artisans, and laborers. They had an extensive trade network,
          exchanging goods such as jade, obsidian, and ceramics with other
          Mesoamerican cultures.
        </li>
        <li>
          Legacy The Olmecs influenced many later Mesoamerican civilizations,
          including the Maya and the Aztec. Their contributions to writing,
          urban planning, and religious practices had a lasting impact.
          Understanding the Olmec culture provides valuable insights into the
          foundations of Mesoamerican civilization and the region rich
          historical tapestry.
