      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Geographical Location:</b> The Olmec heartland is primarily in the
          tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, specifically in the
          modern-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco.
        </li>
        <li>

          1500 BCE to 400 BCE.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Major Sites:</b> San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n: One of the earliest
          Olmec centers, known for its large-scale monuments and complex
          society. La Venta: Famous for its massive earthen pyramid and richly
          decorated tombs. Tres Zapotes: Known for the later phase of Olmec
          civilization and the discovery of the earliest Long Count calendar
          date.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Art and Iconography:</b> Colossal Heads: The Olmecs are famous for
          their enormous stone heads, carved from basalt boulders, which are
          believed to represent rulers. Jade Artifacts: They worked extensively
          with jade, creating small, detailed figurines, masks, and other items.
          Were-Jaguar Motif: A common theme in Olmec art depicting a
          human-jaguar hybrid, symbolizing shamanistic beliefs and the power of
          transformation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Architecture The Olmecs:</b> built large ceremonial centers with
          pyramids, plazas, and platforms. Their architecture was advanced,
          featuring drainage systems and large public spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Writing and Numeration:</b> The Olmecs developed early forms of
          writing and a complex calendar system, which influenced subsequent
          Mesoamerican cultures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Religion and Mythology:</b> The Olmec religion was polytheistic,
          involving various deities connected to natural elements like rain,
          earth, and maize. Shamanism played a significant role, with shamans
          believed to communicate with the spiritual world and transform into
          animals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Society and Politics:</b> Olmec society was hierarchical, with a
          strong centralized leadership and distinct social classes, including
          elites, artisans, and laborers. They had an extensive trade network,
          exchanging goods such as jade, obsidian, and ceramics with other
          Mesoamerican cultures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Legacy:</b> The Olmecs influenced many later Mesoamerican
          civilizations, including the Maya and the Aztec. Their contributions
          to writing, urban planning, and religious practices had a lasting
          impact. Understanding the Olmec culture provides valuable insights
          into the foundations of Mesoamerican civilization and the region rich
          historical tapestry.
